# Activate whitelist

A whitelist is a feature in Minecraft that allows server administrators to create a list of players who are allowed to enter the server, while other players are denied. It is used to keep out unwanted players and allow those who have been approved by the server operator.

## Requirements

* Access to the server console or the in-game chat
* Name of the player you want to add to the whitelist.

## To activate the whitelist, follow these steps:

1. <b>Start the console or chat</b>
    * Open the server console if you have direct access.
    * Open the in-game chat if you are connected via the game

2. <b>Enter the command to activate the whitelist</b>
    In the server console or in-game chat, enter the command to activate the whitelist. The command is:
    ```
    /whitelist on
    ```

3. <b>Enter the command to add someone to the whitelist</b>
    In the server console or in-game chat, enter the command to add someone to the whitelist. The command is:
    ```
    /whitelist add player name
    ```
    Replace ``player name`` with the name of the player you want to add to the whitelist.

4. <b>Confirm the command</b><br>
    Press "Enter" or click on the button to execute the command.

### That's it! With these steps, you should be able to successfully use the whitelist on your Minecraft server.
