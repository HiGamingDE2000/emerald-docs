# Grant OP rights

OP (Operator) rights in Minecraft are special permissions that give a player more power and control on a server. Essentially, OP rights allow you to execute certain commands and make changes to the game world that normal players cannot. For example, a player with OP rights can create or destroy blocks, teleport other players, change the time and weather and perform various administrative tasks at command level.

## Prerequisites

* Access to the server console or the in-game chat
* Name of the player you want to give OP rights to

## To grant OP rights, follow these steps:

1. <b>Start the console or chat</b>
    * Open the server console if you have direct access.
    * Open the in-game chat if you are connected via the game

2. <b>Enter the command</b><br>
    In the server console or in-game, enter the command to give someone OP rights. The command is:
    ```
    /op player name
    ```
    Replace `player name` with the name of the player you want to give OP rights to.
    ::: tip
    Please note that the use of slashes "/" in the commands in the web interface is not required.
    :::

3. <b>Confirm the command</b><br>
    Press "Enter" or click on the button to execute the command.

4. <b>Check the award</b><br>
    Check whether the command was executed successfully by entering the command `/list`. The player to whom you have granted OP rights should appear in the list of OPs.

### That's it! With these steps you should be able to grant OP rights on your Minecraft server via a command.
