## Dear Enshrouded players

We would like to thank you for your passion and commitment to Enshrouded. We realize that some of you may be experiencing server performance issues with your [Enshrouded](https://emeraldhost.de/enshrouded-server-mieten?utm_source=documentation&utm_medium=marketing&utm_campaign=performance-probleme-auf-enshrouded-servern) server, which is the nature of early access games, especially with a title as ambitious as Enshrouded, which features an extensive open world and complex game mechanics.

### Understanding the situation

- The challenges you may encounter, including server lag and other performance issues, are common side effects in the early stages of game development. These issues are often due to optimization needs that will be addressed in future updates.

### Our measures

- **Regular updates and patches:** We work closely with developers to ensure that updates and patches aimed at improving server stability and game performance are deployed regularly.
- **Continuous hardware optimization:** To ensure a steady improvement in server performance, we are constantly looking at hardware upgrades. This includes regular memory and CPU performance upgrades, which help to continuously increase the performance of your servers.
- **Technical support:** Our support team is ready to help with specific problems and offer solutions wherever possible. Do not hesitate to contact us if you encounter any difficulties.
- **Community feedback:** Your feedback is invaluable to the development process. We encourage you to share your experiences and suggestions so that they can be incorporated into future improvements.

### Future Outlook

- We are confident that Enshrouded will get better with each new version. The developers are determined to optimize the game and improve your gaming experience. We ask for your patience and support as we navigate through this Early Access phase together.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. Your enthusiasm and dedication make Enshrouded a special experience, and we look forward to seeing how the game evolves with you.
