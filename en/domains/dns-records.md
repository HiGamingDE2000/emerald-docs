# DNS records

## What are DNS records?

DNS stands for "Domain Name System" and is a system that is used to convert domain names such as "[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)" into IP addresses such as "192.0.2.1". DNS records are special information stored in a DNS server that enables this conversion. They contain various pieces of information that help a computer or other device connect to a specific server or website.

A DNS record usually consists of a name and a value. The name is the domain name to which the entry applies, such as "[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)". The value is the corresponding IP address to which this domain name is to be resolved.

There are different types of DNS records, including:
* A records: These assign an IPv4 address value to a domain.
* AAAA records: These assign an IPv6 address value to a domain.
* MX records: These assign a mail server to a domain name.
* CNAME entries: These assign a different domain name to a domain as an alias.
* TXT records: These can be used for various purposes, such as storing SPF information for email authentication.
* SRV records: These are used to provide information about the available services and servers of a particular domain name.

Overall, DNS records are an important component of the internet as they allow devices to communicate with each other without us having to memorize complicated IP addresses. Without DNS records, it would be very difficult for us humans to visit websites or send emails.
