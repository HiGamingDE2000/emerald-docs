# ServerQuery login

To be able to manage your server via query, we recommend the program "[YaTQA](http://yat.qa/herunterladen/)".\
In addition, server admin rights on the TeamSpeak are required to create a query access.

## Steps

1. connect to your server with the TeamSpeak client.

2. now click on Extras -> ServerQuery Login in your top bar &#x20;

3. now define a name for your admin account and confirm this with "OK".

4. now make a note of the user name and password &#x20;
    ::: warning
    This login data cannot be displayed again, so save it carefully!
    :::

5. now go to our dashboard and select the TeamSpeak on which you created the ServerQuery login.

6. now note the IP address (e.g. 192.168.178.1), the port behind your IP address (e.g. 9001) and the query port below it (e.g. 9152).

7. now install "[YaTQA](http://yat.qa/herunterladen/)" and open the program.

8. if the program is installed and open, click on "Settings" in the left column and set a check mark under "Notes" -> "Allow connection to non-standard query port". The settings can then be closed.

9. to connect now, write your noted data in the following columns:
    * your IP address in column "Server address (without port):"&#x20;
    * your query port in column "Queryport:"
    * your user name in column "User (optional):"&#x20;
    * your password in column "Password (optional):"

    Now confirm your entries with "Connect".

10. to be able to manage the server now, go to the "Server" tab and there to the option "Search server using port...". Enter the port noted after your IP address.
